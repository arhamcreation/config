            <p>Certain aspects of the Service may be provided for a fee or other charge. If you elect to use paid aspects of the Service, you agree to the posted pricing and payment terms as we may update them from time to time. For certain aspects of the Service for which a subscription fee is payable, your subscription will renew automatically at the end of each subscription term until you cancel or downgrade your plan. You authorize Ummy to charge the applicable subscription fees at the then-applicable rate and taxes for the subscription to the credit card on file at each renewal term.</p>
            <p>By purchasing a monthly subscription, you agree to an initial and recurring monthly subscription fee at the then-current subscription rate and you accept the responsibility for all recurring charges. We will continue to automatically process your monthly subscription fee each month at the applicable monthly subscription rate, until you cancel your subscription.</p>
            <p>By purchasing a 6-month subscription, if such subscription is available, you agree to an initial pre-payment for the 6 month of service. After 6 months and semi-annually thereafter, you will be billed a recurring 6-month subscription renewal fee at the applicable subscription rate. We will bill your credit card for the 6-month subscription renewal fee in the first month of your next 6-month subscription.</p>
            <p>By purchasing a "One time fee" subscription, if such subscription is available, you agree to an initial pre-payment for the use of the service during an unlimited period of time. There is no renewal subscription fee. However, please note that other provisions of the Terms of Service are applied, which means that Ummy has no obligations to support the functionality of the service during the unlimited period of time and the services provided on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis.</p>
            <p>You may cancel your current subscription renewal plan at any time before the next billing cycle of the subscription plan by using link that is specified in the purchase confirmation letter or contacting our support directly at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dbaeb6b6a2a8b4bdaf9bbcb6bab2b7f5b8b4b6"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="186d7575616b777e6c587f75797174367b7775">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>. Please note that the already billed subscription fees are non-refundable. Ummy may cancel subscriptions without prior notice if we are unable to process payment through the provided method of payment. Ummy may add new services for additional fees and charges, or amend fees and charges for existing services, at any time in its sole discretion. In the event that Ummy suspends or terminates your account, you understand and agree that you shall receive no refund.</p>
